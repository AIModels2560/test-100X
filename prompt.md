You are a senior Product Manager with deep experience in AI-powered conversational agents.
I need you to write a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an AI Agent whose primary function is to automatically place a phone call (or VoIP call) to any user immediately after they complete our website’s “Request a Demo” form. The PRD must include:

Executive Summary

One-paragraph overview of the feature, target users, and business value.

Key success metrics (e.g. call connection rate, lead conversion uplift).

Background & Problem Statement

Why we need instant callback (long form-to-call delays, low demo conversion).

Data or anecdotes demonstrating current pain.

Goals & Key Metrics

Primary objectives (e.g. reduce time-to-first-touch to <30 seconds).

KPIs (answer rate, demo booked %, user satisfaction score).

Success criteria thresholds.

User Personas & Journeys

Define 2–3 personas (e.g. “Enterprise Buyer,” “SMB Owner”).

Map their journey from form submission through call completion.

Core Features & Requirements
For each feature, include a one-line description, user story, and acceptance criteria:

Trigger & Data Flow

User submits form → Agent is notified via webhook/queue.

User Verification & Number Validation

Auto-format, validate, and (if invalid) send email fallback.

Dialing Logic & Retry

First ring attempt, 2 retries at X-minute intervals, voicemail detection.

Conversation Handling

Welcome greeting, brief agenda (“I’m calling from X…”), calendar link integration.

Call Recording & Transcription

Consent capture, storage, and metadata tagging.

CRM & Analytics Integration

Push call outcome, transcript, and lead interest level back into Salesforce/HubSpot.

Non-Functional Requirements

Reliability (99.9 % uptime), latency (<5 sec from form to dial).

Scalability (up to 1,000 calls/hour).

Security & compliance (PCI, GDPR, call recording laws).

Architecture & Tech Stack

High-level system diagram (webhook → orchestration layer → telephony API → CRM).

Recommended services (Twilio/SignalWire for voice; AWS Lambda for logic; DynamoDB/Postgres for state).

UX & UI Considerations

Back-office dashboard mockups for monitoring call queue.

Notifications/alerts for failed calls.

Dependencies & Risks

Third-party API SLAs.

Phone number privacy regulations.

Risk mitigation (fallback email/SMS).

Rollout & Validation Plan

Phased launch (5 % of traffic → 25 % → 100 %).

A/B test vs. manual callback process.

Metrics to monitor during each phase.

Timeline & Milestones

30/60/90 day roadmap, with deliverables for each sprint.

Please structure the PRD in clear headings and bullet lists, and include any diagrams or table placeholders as appropriate.
