Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI-Powered Callback Agent
Objective:
You are a Senior Product Manager with extensive experience in AI-powered conversational agents. Your task is to develop a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an AI Agent whose primary function is to automatically place a phone call (or VoIP call) to a user immediately after they complete a “Request a Demo” form on our website.

The PRD must include the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
Overview: Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the feature, identifying the target users and outlining the business value.

Key Success Metrics: Specify the metrics that will indicate success (e.g., call connection rate, lead conversion uplift, average response time).

2. Background & Problem Statement
Purpose: Explain the rationale for implementing instant callbacks.

Problem Analysis: Highlight the current challenges, such as delays in form-to-call conversion, missed opportunities, and low demo conversion rates.

Supporting Data: Include relevant data points or anecdotes to illustrate the impact of the problem.

3. Goals & Key Metrics
Primary Objectives: Clearly define the primary objectives (e.g., reduce time-to-first-contact to under 30 seconds).

KPIs: Identify key performance indicators such as:

Answer Rate

Demo Booked Percentage

User Satisfaction Score

Success Criteria: Outline specific success thresholds for each KPI.

4. User Personas & Journeys
Target Personas: Define 2-3 user personas (e.g., “Enterprise Buyer,” “SMB Owner”).

User Journeys: Map each persona’s journey from form submission through call completion.

5. Core Features & Requirements
For each feature, include a brief description, a user story, and acceptance criteria:

a. Trigger & Data Flow:

User Story: As a user, when I submit a “Request a Demo” form, the AI Agent should be notified instantly.

Requirements: Form submission triggers a webhook or queue for processing.

b. User Verification & Number Validation:

User Story: As a user, I want my phone number to be verified to ensure successful callback attempts.

Requirements:

Auto-format phone number

Validate number against known formats

Fallback email notification if number is invalid

c. Dialing Logic & Retry:

User Story: As a user, I should receive a callback attempt immediately after form submission, with retries if unanswered.

Requirements:

First attempt within 30 seconds

Two retries at X-minute intervals

Voicemail detection and fallback logic

d. Conversation Handling:

User Story: As a user, I want a seamless conversation experience that includes a welcome greeting and demo scheduling.

Requirements:

Predefined greeting and agenda introduction

Calendar link integration for scheduling demos

e. Call Recording & Transcription:

User Story: As a business, I need calls to be recorded and transcribed for future reference and compliance.

Requirements:

Consent capture before recording

Secure storage and metadata tagging

f. CRM & Analytics Integration:

User Story: As a sales rep, I want call outcomes and lead data automatically pushed to the CRM.

Requirements:

CRM integration (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot)

Data tagging and lead scoring based on call outcome

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Reliability: 99.9% uptime, with monitoring and alerting.

Latency: Call initiation within 5 seconds of form submission.

Scalability: Handle up to 1,000 calls per hour.

Security & Compliance: PCI, GDPR, and call recording laws compliance.

7. Architecture & Tech Stack
System Architecture: Include a high-level diagram that depicts the data flow:

Webhook → Orchestration Layer → Telephony API → CRM

Recommended Services:

Telephony API: Twilio, SignalWire

Logic Processing: AWS Lambda

Data Storage: DynamoDB, PostgreSQL

8. UX & UI Considerations
Dashboard Mockups: Back-office dashboard for monitoring call queue and outcomes.

Notifications/Alerts: Alerts for failed calls and system errors.

9. Dependencies & Risks
Third-Party SLAs: Monitor telephony API uptime and performance.

Compliance Risks: Ensure data privacy and consent for call recording.

Mitigation Strategies: Implement fallback options (e.g., SMS, email) in case of failed calls.

10. Rollout & Validation Plan
Phased Launch:

Phase 1: 5% of traffic (Pilot Test)

Phase 2: 25% of traffic (A/B Testing)

Phase 3: 100% of traffic (Full Rollout)

Metrics Monitoring: Track KPIs in each phase to validate system performance.

11. Timeline & Milestones
30-Day Milestone: Initial MVP with form submission and callback functionality.

60-Day Milestone: CRM Integration, Call Recording, and Retry Logic.

90-Day Milestone: Full deployment, monitoring dashboard, and analytics reporting.

Submission Guidelines:
Structure the PRD using clear headings, bullet points, and concise language.

Include visual placeholders for diagrams and tables where necessary.

Ensure all technical and user-centric requirements are clearly defined and measurable.
